# Bitcoin Does Not Solve Byzantine Generals

Recently [Emin Gun Sirer][Sirer2016] argued that Bitcoin provides
strong consistency, not eventual consistency (as was argued by
[Bitcoin Meets Strong Consistency][DeckerSeidelWattenhofer2014]).  In
this short note, I want to do two things:  
* provide a brief counter-example, based only on publicly known
  properties of Bitcoin, that it _cannot_ provide strong consistency.  
* recap Sirer's argument in detail, pointing out where I believe his
  mistake lies.
